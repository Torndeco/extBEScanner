# extBEScanner
Arma3 Extension BattlEye Scanner C++

This is just a placeholder.  

extBEScanner is really a version of pyBEscanner but coded in C++ & comes in a standalone executable + arma extension.  

Advantages are people running a server on GSP will be able to use this.  

Basicly the extension is callExtension @ server startup, where it then runs in the background.  
When it comes to kick / ban players extension uses RCon to issue rcon commands etc.
